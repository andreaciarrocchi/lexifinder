# Lexifinder
Lexifinder is a tool to create the analytical index (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(publishing)) of a manuscript. First, you need to convert your manuscript to PDF with your word processor. This is because docx and odt formats do not store information about page numbers: these are calculated at time of rendering. Therefore, the only way to obtain a reliable result is to convert your file to pdf.
